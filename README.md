# Generative Adversarial Networks for Disentangling And Learning Framework (GANDALF) 
GANDALF is an ad-hoc framework written in Python to define, train, test and visualize disentangling models. It is divided into two modules. The [train](gandalf/train/) module, where you can define, train and test different models, and the [visualization](gandalf/visualization) folder, a bokeh server who display a representation of the model, allowing not just its visualization, but also interactions to understand how it works.


The project is structured as follow:

## Packaging project
Through the `.toml` file you can build this project using `build` to create a wheel that can be installed with `pip` (name of the `.whl` file is subject to change). 
All the dependencies used in this project will also be installed:

```
python -m build

pip install .\dist\gandalf-2.0.0-py3-none-any.whl 
```

Then you can use the cli tools installed simply calling them:

```
train_cli --help
test_cli --help
```

The installation will also include the dataset located in `gandalf/train/data/sample`, so that you can carry out a verification test easily. For instance:
```
train_cli --epochs 5 -vv
test_cli <generated_model_id> --tsne_comparison
```

Note that the sample dataset it just for testing purposes.

You also can work with GANDALF without the need of the packaging process. Use [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) to install all the dependencies with `pip`. You can work with `train_cli` and `test_cli` also as scripts. 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python gandalf/train/train_cli.py --epochs 5 -vv
python gandalf/train/test_cli.py <generated_model_id> --tsne_comparison
```

NOTE: This has been tested using python 3.7.
